	Someone on Github asked me to create a Readme file for the project for anyone stumbling upon it.

	This is my summer project for my programming classes, we were told to recreate an old arcade game over ten(?) weeks of summer
	and i decided to make my own version of Asteroids.
	
	While the code is technically written from scratch i do take a lot of help from a previous project regarding code structure and syntax.
	Because of this the structure of the code might seem a bit excessive for the project i'm making but
	i belive it's good to have it done right even if my game is a bit simpler than the previous project.

	The code is built from the Engine.cpp file where it updates game events through several managers. 
	As of now it's got a pretty long pipline and i'll look into shortening it a bit.
	For the project i am using the SFML library.

	I'll go further into the structure of the project in later versions of this readme.

	The project also requires us to write a devloper blog once every week about our work, mine can be found at: http://hermanbatelsson.wordpress.com/ Relevant posts tagged "summer"
